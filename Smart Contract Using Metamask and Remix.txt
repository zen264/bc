-------------------------

1. Go to Chrome Web Store and search for MetaMask.

2. Click on "Add to Chrome".

3. Click on "Get Started".

4. Click on "Create Wallet" and then click on "I Agree".

5. Create a password and click on "Create a New Wallet".

6. Click on "Secure my wallet".

7. Write down your Secret Recovery Phrase somewhere safe in your system.

8. Click on "Confirm" by entering the Secret Recovery Phrase.

9. Click on "Done" to finalize the MetaMask Wallet account. 
   Once you have completed the account creation process, you will be greeted with the main MetaMask screen.

10. Next, click on the network drop-down (top center of MetaMask) and choose 
    "Show/Hide Test Networks" as seen in the image below.

11. Toggle "Show Test Networks" to ON, then scroll to the top and close the settings.

12. Now click on the networks tab again. You will see a list of test networks, including 
    an option to add a custom one.

13. We will use the Goerli Test Network.

14. We need to add test Ether to the Goerli account in order to complete transactions on 
    the MetaMask Wallet. 
    Use the following link for the Goerli Faucet to get Test Ether:
    https://goerlifaucet.com/

15. Copy your account address from MetaMask Wallet and paste it into the Goerli Faucet 
    website, then click on "Send me ETH". 
    Fake/Test 0.2 ETH will be added to your MetaMask Wallet.

16. Open Remix IDE using the following link:
    https://remix.ethereum.org

17. Create a new file named "hello.sol".

18. Write the following sample code in the editor:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.13;

contract hello {
    function sayHelloWorld() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}

19. Compile the code by clicking "Compile Hello.sol".

20. Go to "DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTION".

21. Select Environment as "Injected Provider â€“ MetaMask" and click on "Deploy".

22. Click on the "Deploy" button to connect with your MetaMask wallet.

23. Once you click on "Connect", the transaction will appear in the MetaMask wallet.

24. Click on "Confirm" to finalize the transaction. 
    The transaction will be executed in the wallet, and gas fees will be deducted from your account as contract fees.

25. You can now see the contract details in your wallet.

26. Transaction details will also be reflected on the Goerli Test Network:
